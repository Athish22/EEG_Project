# EEG Project: Frontal Electrode Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the effect of frontal electrodes on EEG data. While the original study was implemented in MATLAB, we have reproduced the workflow using Python.

## Workflow

To reproduce our results, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

* Tested on Python 3.12

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Dataset and Configuration

### Dataset

Download the latest dataset from OpenNeuro:

* Dataset Link: [Dataset Link from OpenNeuro]

### Configuration

Update the dataset directory paths as needed in your configuration files (e.g., in your Python scripts).
